# Rename this file to local_env.yml
# Add account settings and API keys here.
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry gets set as a local environment variable.
# This file overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Gmail_Username'
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
# Uncomment for production only
# NBJC_APP_DATABASE_IP: 'replace with database IP address from digital ocean'
# NBJC_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD: 'replace with acual value'

# Needed for test setup
PGUSER: 'nbjc_app'
PGPASSWORD: 'postgres'  # make sure you set the nbjc_app user to have the password specified here
# Will be overridden with test when running rspec
RAILS_ENV: 'development'
